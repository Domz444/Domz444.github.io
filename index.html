    <p class="center">EPISODE I<br />
     A new hope</p>

    <p>It is a period of war in the galactic empire for developers</p>

    <p>Our story begins when the rebel alliance, also known as UNOMENA hired there first ever intern in hopes of training their very own Jedi fit for the Job</p>

    <p>Rumours have it that Master Yoda or as we call him "Euan" wants to train someone in the forces of CSS, JS, Python, Django, Jira and Photoshop</p>

    <p>Although the journery is tough and seems long, the force is Strong with the Unomena empire and way forward is bright and full of hope</p>

    <p>The young padawans(Interns) embark on the journey of Testing in week 2 with Odwa also known as Han Solo where all areas of the Force of Unomenas portfolio need to be tested for weaknesses after the Padawans are acclimatised they will go on to the land of Project Management in week 3 where just for a week the Padawan will indeed become the Master and make sure all work is going according to Master Yodas plan </p>

    <p>Week 4 sees the Padawans go back to the drawing board or in this case Photoshop where they will put there creativity and styling to the test to see if they have the finesse that is truely needed in a Unomena Jedi, Next ( Week 5 and 6 ) the Interns go into the deep dark side of the force known as Frontend where Master Vader aka Andro tries to lure the padawans into the Frontend forces of js and css</p>

    <p>Week 7 and probably the toughest and most enduring part of all is when the Padawans undertake the deadly and difficult forces of System Admin where they will try to configure the Death Star itself to host all the Unomena projects</p>

    <p>Week 8 the padawans will join th backend forces of Python and Django and work with Master Thys and Keenan to journey into unmarked teritory and build the Unomena Empire without a lightsaber but with Sublime Text</p>

    <p>Lastly the Padawans will use all they hae learned on the long journey to start their own journey and showcase their skills to earn a place as a Jedi on the Unomena team</p>
